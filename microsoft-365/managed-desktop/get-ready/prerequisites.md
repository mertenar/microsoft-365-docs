Licensing | A Microsoft 365 E5 license or equivalent licenses are required.<br><br>This license includes Office 365 E5, Windows 10 Enterprise E5 & Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) E5.

Azure Active Directory |	Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) must either be the source of authority for all user accounts, or user accounts must be synchronized from on-premises Active Directory using the latest supported version of Azure AD Connect.<br><br>For more information on Azure AD Connect, see [Azure AD Connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-azure-ad-connect).<br><br>For more information on supported Azure AD Connect versions, see [Azure AD Connect:Version release history](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/reference-connect-version-history).
Authentication |	If Azure AD is not the source of authority for user accounts, you must configure one of these in Azure AD Connect:<br>- Password Hash Synchronization<br>- Pass-Through Authentication<br>- Federation with ADFS<br><br>When setting authentication options with Azure AD Connect Password writeback is also required.

Office 365 |	Though it is not required to enroll with Microsoft Managed Desktop, it is highly recommended that the following services be migrated to the cloud:<br>- Email - Migrate to cloud-based mailboxes, Exchange online or be configured with Exchange Online Hybrid with Exchange 2013 or higher, on-premises.<br>- Files & Folders – Migrate to OneDrive for Business/SharePoint Online.<br>- Online Collaboration Tools – Migrate to Teams.
Device management | Microsoft Managed Desktop devices require management using Microsoft Intune. Intune must be set as the Mobile Device Management authority.<br><br>For more information, see [Microsoft Intune](https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-platform/microsoft-intune). 
Data back-up and recovery |	Microsoft Managed Desktop requires files to be synced to OneDrive for Business for protection. Any files not synced to OneDrive for Business are not guaranteed by Microsoft Managed Desktop and may be lost during device exchanges, or support calls requiring a device reset.<br><br>Though not required, Microsoft Managed Desktop strongly recommends migration from mapped network drives to the appropriate cloud solution.
