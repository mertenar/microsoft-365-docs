# Admin support for Microsoft Managed Desktop

You can submit Support tickets or Feedback requests to Microsoft using the Microsoft Managed Desktop Administrative Portal. Support requests are always prioritized over Feedback submissions. Support requests are triaged and managed according to Severity as outlined in the [severity definition table](#sev). Feedback is reviewed, and a response provided where requested. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Make sure that you [set up an Admin contact](../get-started/add-admin-contacts.md) for app packaging, devices, security, and other. You are unable to submit a Support request in any of these areas if an admin contact is not configured.

**To submit a support request**
1. Sign in to [Microsoft Managed Desktop Admin portal](http://aka.ms/mwaasportal). 
2. On **Support requests**, select **+ New Support ticket**.
3. Select the **Support request type** that matches the help you need. The table below outlines the options. 
4. Select the **Severity level**. For more information, see [Support request severity definitions](#sev). 

Support request type | When to use
--- | ---

Request for information | You are planning a change for networking, proxy configuration, VPN systems, certificate expiration, or just need some information about the service. A response from the Microsoft Managed Desktop Operations Team is strongly advised when communicating a change within your organization.

## Support request severity definitions

Initial response time is the period from when you submit your support request to when a Microsoft Managed Desktop engineer contacts you and starts working on your support request. The initial response time varies with the business impact of the request, based on the severity of the request.

Severity level	| Customer situation |	Initial response time	| Expected customer response
--- | --- | --- | ---
**Severity A – Critical Impact** |	**Critical business impact**<br><br>Customer’s business has significant loss or degradation of services and requires immediate attention.<br><br>**Major application compatibility impact**<br><br>The customer’s entire business is experiencing financial impact due to crashing or loss of critical functionality | Initial: < 1 hour<br>Update: 60 minutes<br>24x7 available | When you select Severity A, you confirm that the issue has critical business impact, with severe loss and degradation of services. <br><br>The issue demands an immediate response, and you commit to continuous 24x7 operation every day with the Microsoft team until resolution, otherwise, Microsoft may at its discretion decrease the Severity to level B.<br><br> You also ensure that Microsoft has your accurate contact information. 
**Severity B – Moderate Impact** |	**Moderate business impact**<br><br>Customer’s business has moderate loss or degradation of services, but work can reasonably continue in an impaired manner.<br><br>**Moderate application compatibility impact**<br><br>A specific business group is no longer productive, due to crashing behavior or loss of critical functionality. |	Initial: < 4 hours<br>Update: 12 hours<br>Business hours (24x7 available) | When you select Severity B, you confirm that the issue has moderate impact to your business with loss and degradation of services, but workarounds enable reasonable, albeit temporary, business continuity. <br><br>The issue demands an urgent response. If you chose 24x7 when you submit the support request, you commit to a continuous 24x7 operation every day with the Microsoft team until resolution, otherwise, Microsoft may at its discretion decrease the severity to level C. If you chose business-hours support when you submit a Severity B incident, Microsoft will contact you during business hours only.<br><br>You also ensure that Microsoft has your accurate contact information.
**Severity C – Minimal Impact** |	**Minimum business impact**<br><br> Customer’s business is functioning with minor impediments of services.<br><br>**Minor application compatibility impact**<br><br>Potentially unrelated users experience minor compatibility issues that do not prevent productivity |	Initial: < 8 hours<br>Update: 24 hours<br>Business hours  |	When you select Severity C, you confirm that the issue has minimum impact to your business with minor impediment of service.<br><br>For a Severity C incident, Microsoft will contact you during business hours only.<br><br>You also ensure that Microsoft has your accurate contact information

Additional details:
- **Support languages** - All support is provided in English.
- **Severity level changes** - Microsoft may downgrade the severity level if the customer is not able to provide adequate resources or responses to enable Microsoft to continue with problem resolution efforts. 
- **Business hours** - For most countries, business hours are from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Pacific Standard Time.
- **Application compatibility** - For an application compatibility issue to be considered, there must be a reproduceable error, of the same version of the application, between the previous and current version of Windows or Office. To resolve application compatibility issues, Microsoft requires a customer point of contact to work with. The individual must work directly with our Fast Track team to investigate and resolve the issue.
- **Customer response time** If a customer is unable to meet the expected response requirements, Microsoft will downgrade the request by one severity level, to a minimum of Severity C. If a customer is unresponsive to requests for action, Microsoft will mitigate and close the support request within 48 hours of the last request.
